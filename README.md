### 1. Data preprocessing : 
- Data wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis on covid dataset
- Visualisation 

### 2. Linear regression :
- Gradient descent implementation to optimize the loss function from scratch.
- The normal equation implementation to find the best parameters that minimize the loss function.


### 3. Support vector machine :



### 4. K-Nearest neighbors :
- Implementation of k-NN from scratch.
- Implementation of K-NN with `scikit-learn`.
- Performing binary classification using K-NN.


### 5. Decision trees : 
- Implementing and visuailzing decison trees `scikit-learn`.
- Analyzing the effect of the maximum tree depth and criterion on the train and test accuracy.
- Plot decision tree graphs of a given dataset.
